2505.04198v1,A Predictive Theory of Electrochemical Ostwald Ripening for Electrodeposited Lithium Metal,2025,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.soft, physics.chem-ph","in this work, we present a theoretical framework that describes the evolution
of lithium nuclei under the competing effects of electroplating and surface
energy-driven redistribution (electrochemical ostwald ripening). our model
introduces a formulation that accounts for solid electrolyte interphase (sei)
resistance, electrolyte conductivity, and electrode wettability, capturing the
transition from sei to electrolyte-limited growth regimes. we identify
asymptotic behaviors for high and low current densities, quantify the
conditions under which ripening dominates, and derive analytical expressions
for nucleus size, density, and surface coverage. model predictions show
excellent agreement with experimental data across multiple datasets. the
results reveal how sei and electrolyte conductivity, current density and
metal-electrode contact angle govern deposition morphology and coulombic
efficiency. based on these insights, we outline experimentally accessible
guidelines to improve battery efficiency and cycling stability - offering a
simple yet predictive approach for optimizing metal electrodeposition processes

in those undergoing large volume changes, such as lithium metal batteries. in
particular, the li$^+$ electroplating process in large format pouch cells
occurs at a larger dimension compared to those in smaller lab-scale cells. a
fundamental linkage between external pressure and large format electroplating
of li$^+$ remains missing but yet critically needed to understand the
electrochemical behavior of li$^+$ in practical batteries. herein, this work
utilizes 350 wh/kg lithium metal pouch cell as a model system to study the
electroplating of li$^+$ ions and the impact of external pressure. the
vertically applied uniaxial pressure on the batteries using liquid electrolyte
profoundly affects the electroplating process of li$^+$ which is well reflected
by the self-generated pressures in the cell and can be correlated to battery
cycling stability. taking advantage of both constant gap and pressure
application, all li metal pouch cells demonstrated minimum swelling of 6-8%
after 300 cycles, comparable to that of state-of-the-art li-ion batteries.
along the horizontal directions, the pressure distributed across the surface of
li metal pouch cell reveals a unique phenomenon of li$^+$ migration during the
electroplating (charge) process driven by an uneven distribution of external
pressure across the large electrode area, leading to a preferred li plating in
the center area of li metal anode. this work addresses a longstanding question

circuit, to the next-generation high-energy-density lithium (li) metal
batteries. the development of successful li dendrite mitigation strategies is
impeded by an insufficient understanding of li dendrite growth mechanisms.
li-plating-induced internal stress in li metal and its effect on dendrite
growth have been studied in previous models and experiments, while the
underlying microcosmic mechanism is elusive. here, we analyze the role of
plating-induced stress in dendrite formation through first-principles
calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. we show that the
deposited li forms a stable atomic nanofilm structure on copper (cu) substrate.
it is found that the adsorption energy of li atoms increases from the li-cu
interface to deposited li surface, leading to more aggregated li atoms at the
interface. compared to the pristine li metal, the deposited li in the early
stage becomes compacted and suffers in-plane compressive stress. interestingly,
we find that there is a giant strain gradient distribution from the li-cu
interface to deposited li surface, which makes the deposited atoms adjacent to
the cu surface tend to press upwards with perturbation, causing the dendrite
growth. this understanding provides an insight to the atomic-scale origin of li
dendrite growth and may be useful for suppressing the li dendrite in the
li-metal-based rechargeable batteries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.01236v1,Downloaded (1518.53 KB),"lithium, cu, copper",38,pdfs/2001.01236v1.pdf
2302.10232v1,Moss-like growth of metal electrodes: On the role of competing faradaic reactions and fast-charging,2023,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"uncontrolled crystal growth during electroreduction of reactive metals in
liquid electrolytes produces porous, low-density, mossy metal deposits that
grow primarily along the surface normal vector to a planar electrode substrate.
the moss-like deposits are fragile and cause premature failure of batteries by
chemical, physical, and mechanical pathways. here we use electroanalytical
rotating-disk electrode (rde) studies in a three-electrode electrochemical cell
to elucidate the fundamental origin of moss-like growth of metals. we report
that competing faradaic reactions occurring on the electrode surface is the
source of the phenomenon. on this basis, we conclude that a moss-like growth
regime can be accessed during electrodeposition of any metal by subtle shifts
in electrolyte chemistry and deposition rate. specifically, for zn, a metal
that conventionally is not known to form moss-like electrodeposits, obvious
moss-like deposition patterns emerge at low-current densities in
strongly-alkaline electrolytes that undergo electroreduction to form an
interphase on the electrodeposited zn. conversely, we find that under
conditions where the rate of metal electroplating is large relative to that of
other competing faradaic reactions, it is possible to eliminate the mossy-like
growth regime for zn. taken together, our findings open up a new approach for
simultaneously achieving favorable metal deposition morphology and fast

2502.05809v2,Achieving electrode smoothing by controlling the nucleation phase of metal deposition through polymer-substrate binding,2025,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (peo)] are widely used for smooth
electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and a number of other battery systems
currently investigated for energy storage applications. however, the precise
mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation

electrochemical atomic force microscopy (ec-afm) to directly observe the
interfacial evolution during zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on
copper (cu) substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of znso4 and
peo. contrary to previous literature assumptions which emphasize the binding to
the growing zn crystal surfaces or zn2+ ions, our results demonstrate that peo
smooths zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)-oriented zn platelets through
interactions with the cu substrate. density functional theory (dft) simulations
support this finding by showing that peo adsorption on cu modifies the
interfacial energy of zn/cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization
of zn (002) on the cu substrate, as well as confines zn electrodeposition to a
narrow near-surface region. these findings elucidate a novel design principle

introducing additional overpotential due to its bulk distortion and anchoring
free energy. by extending the phase-field model, we simulate the morphological

the composition analysis of the deposits showed that the ni:co ratio exhibits a
minimum as a function of the cu deposition potential, which can be explained by
considering both the dissolution of co and the mass transport of the reactants.
both the saturation gmr value and the intensity of the satellite peaks in the
x-ray diffractograms were highly correlated with the resulting surface
roughness of the deposits which was strongly varying with the cu deposition
potential. higher gmr values, lower saturation fields and more perfect

alloying and chemical intermixing under normal circumstances. a notable example
that takes advantages of the immiscibility between cu and li is the widespread
utilization of cu foils as the anodic current collector in li-ion batteries.
here we show that the nanoscale size effect can play a subtle yet critical role
in mediating the chemical activity of cu and therefore its miscibility with li,
such that the electrochemical alloying and solid-state amorphization will occur
in such an immiscible system when decreasing cu nanoparticle sizes into
ultrasmall range. this unusual observation was accomplished by performing
in-situ studies of the electrochemical lithiation processes of individual cuo
nanowires inside a transmission electron microscopy (tem). upon lithiation, cuo
nanowires are first electrochemically reduced to form discrete ultrasmall cu
nanocrystals that, unexpectedly, can in turn undergo further electrochemical
lithiation to form amorphous culix nanoalloys. real-time dynamic observations
by in-situ tem unveil that there is a critical grain size (ca. 6 nm), below
which the crystalline cu nanoparticles can be continuously lithiated and
amorphized. electron energy loss spectra indicate that there is a net charge
transfer from li to cu in the amorphous culix nanoalloys. another intriguing
finding is that the amorphous alloying phenomena in cu-li system is reversible,

efforts have been done, the effects of three key parameters of the 3d current
collectors, namely the surface area, the tortuosity factor, and the surface
chemistry, on the performance of lithium metal batteries remain elusive.
herein, we quantitatively studied the role of these three parameters by
synthesizing four types of porous copper networks with different sizes of
well-structured micro-channels. x-ray microscale computed tomography (micro-ct)
allowed us to assess the surface area, the pore size and the tortuosity factor

the influence of surface chemistry on the performance of the 3d current

the role of the tortuosity factor in lithiation. by understanding these

thereby can safely access higher energy density than available with today's

morphological instabilities that lead to poor coulombic efficiency and, in the
worst case, internal short circuits. in this work, lithium electrodeposition
experiments were performed using single-crystal li6la3zrtao12 garnet as solid
electrolyte layers to investigate the factors that determine whether lithium
penetration occurs through brittle inorganic solid electrolytes. in these
single crystals, grain boundaries are excluded as possible paths for lithium
metal propagation. however, vickers microindentation was used to introduce
sharp surface flaws of known size. using operando optical microscopy, it was
found that lithium metal penetration sometimes initiates at these controlled
surface defects, and when multiple indents of varying size were present,
propagates preferentially from the largest defect. however, a second class of
flaws was found to be equally or more important. at the perimeter of surface
current collectors, an enhanced electrodeposition current density causes
lithium metal filled cracks to initiate and grow to penetration, even when the
large vickers defects are in close proximity. modeling the electric field
concentration for the experimental configurations, it was shown that a factor
of 5 enhancement in field can readily occur within 10 micrometers of current
collector discontinuities, which we interpret as the origin of

1008.3542v1,The Atomic-scale Growth of Large-Area Monolayer Graphene on Single-Crystal Copper Substrates,2010,cond-mat.mes-hall,"we study the growth and microscopic structure of large-area graphene
monolayers, grown on copper single crystals by chemical vapor deposition (cvd)
in ultra-high vacuum (uhv). using atomic-resolution scanning tunneling
microscopy (stm), we find that graphene grows primarily in registry with the
underlying copper lattice for both cu(111) and cu(100). the graphene has a
hexagonal superstructure on cu(111) with a significant electronic component,
whereas it has a linear superstructure on cu(100). the film quality is limited
by grain boundaries, and the best growth is obtained on the cu(111) surface.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.3542v1,Downloaded (2269.55 KB),"cu, deposition, copper",38,pdfs/1008.3542v1.pdf
1610.05631v1,"Preparation, structure and giant magnetoresistance of electrodeposited Fe Co/Cu multilayers",2016,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"no systematic studies have been carried out on the giant magnetoresistance
(gmr) of electrodeposited (ed) fe-co/cu multilayers since the elaboration of a
method for the optimization of the cu layer deposition potential. in this
paper, we present results on the electrochemical optimization of the cu layer
deposition potential which was found to depend on the relative iron
concentration in the bath. an x-ray diffraction study of ed fe5co95(1.5
nm)/cu(dcu) multilayers with dcu ranging from 0.8 nm to 10 nm revealed an fcc
structure. for most of the multilayers, a weak superlattice satellite
reflection could be identified. the room-temperature magnetoresistance was
studied in detail as a function of the individual layer thicknesses.
multilayers with cu layer thicknesses above about 1.5 nm were found to exhibit
a gmr behavior with a maximum gmr of about 5 % and a typical saturation field
of 1 koe. the gmr magnitude decreased with increasing fe-content in the
magnetic layer. the spacer layer thickness evolution of the mr data was
established in detail after separating the ferromagnetic and superparamagnetic
gmr contributions and no oscillatory gmr was found. a comparison with
literature data on both physically deposited and ed fe-co/cu multilayers is
also made.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05631v1,Downloaded (749.74 KB),"cu, deposition",25,pdfs/1610.05631v1.pdf

1604.04200v1,Stable artificial solid electrolyte interfaces for lithium batteries,2016,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"a rechargeable lithium metal battery (lmb), which uses metallic lithium at
the anode, is among the most promising technologies for next generation
electrochemical energy storage devices due to its high energy density,
particularly when li is paired with energetic conversion cathodes such as
sulfur, oxygen/air, and carbon dioxide. practical lmbs in any of these designs
remain elusive due to multiple stubborn problems, including parasitic reactions
of li metal with liquid electrolytes, unstable/dendritic electrodeposition at
the anode during cell recharge, and chemical reaction of dissolved cathode
conversion products with the li anode. the solid electrolyte interface (sei)
formed between lithium metal and liquid electrolytes plays a critical role in
all of these processes. we report on the chemistry and interfacial properties
of artificial sei films created by in-situ reaction of a strong lewis acid ali3
additive, li metal, and aprotic liquid electrolytes. we find that these sei
films impart exceptional interfacial stability to a li metal anode. we further
show that the improvements come from at least three processes: (i) in-situ
formation of li-al alloy, (ii) formation of a lii salt layer on li, and (iii)
creation of a stable polymer thin film on the lithium metal anode.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.04200v1,Downloaded (1044.62 KB),"battery, lithium, cu, deposition, electrodeposition",62,pdfs/1604.04200v1.pdf
2504.05612v1,High-efficiency broadband active metasurfaces via reversible metal electrodeposition,2025,"physics.optics, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.app-ph","realizing active metasurfaces with substantial tunability is important for
many applications but remains challenging due to difficulties in dynamically
tuning light-matter interactions at subwavelength scales. here, we introduce
reversible metal electrodeposition as a versatile approach for enabling active
metasurfaces with exceptional tunability across a broad bandwidth. as a proof
of concept, we demonstrate a dynamic beam-steering device by performing
reversible copper (cu) electrodeposition on a reflective gradient metasurface
composed of metal-insulator-metal resonators. by applying different voltages,
the cu atoms can be uniformly and reversibly electrodeposited and stripped
around the resonators, effectively controlling the gap-surface plasmon
resonances and steering the reflected light. this process experimentally
achieved >90% diffraction efficiencies and >60% reflection efficiencies in both
specular and anomalous modes, even after thousands of cycles. moreover, these
high efficiencies can be extended from the visible to the near- and
mid-infrared regimes, demonstrating the broad versatility of this approach in
enabling various active optical and thermal devices with different working
wavelengths and bandwidths.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05612v1,Downloaded (7592.75 KB),"cu, deposition, electrodeposition, copper",50,pdfs/2504.05612v1.pdf
